## 🛑 Common Mistakes That Cause Failures

### 1. Not Reinstalling Windows Properly
**Symptom:** Spoofer shows green but you still get banned  
**Why:** Old hardware traces remain in registry  
**Fix:** Do a complete reinstall with disk formatting

### 2. Skipping BIOS Configuration
**Symptom:** Spoofer crashes or doesn't load  
**Why:** Secure Boot and TPM interfere with spoofer  
**Fix:** Go back and configure BIOS correctly

### 3. Using WiFi Instead of Ethernet
**Symptom:** Inconsistent results, MAC spoof fails  
**Why:** WiFi adapters harder to spoof properly  
**Fix:** Use Ethernet cable or get new WiFi adapter

### 4. Antivirus Not Fully Disabled
**Symptom:** Spoofer gets deleted or blocked  
**Why:** Windows Defender/antivirus quarantines spoofer  
**Fix:** Disable completely using our guide

### 5. Installing Windows Updates First
**Symptom:** Defender re-enables, drivers reinstall  
**Why:** Updates override your settings  
**Fix:** Disable updates, spoof first, then update if needed

### 6. Game-Specific Requirements Ignored
**Symptom:** Ban within hours/days  
**Why:** Each game tracks different identifiers  
**Fix:** Follow game-specific guides exactly
