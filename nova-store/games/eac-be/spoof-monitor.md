# Spoof Monitor (Apex)

### Just for Apex

### Change monitor serials

Open the folder where the loader is and open the folder "Monitor Spoof"

**Disable G-SYNC if your monitor supports that**

Follow the video to change the serials for all your monitors: [https://streamable.com/6ibjqa](https://streamable.com/6ibjqa)

Change only a few serial numbers.

Replace number for number and letter for letter. Example: Xka25 → Vga62 (not something like 2374K).

If your "serial number" is empty, do not modify it.

### If this happens:

**If your monitor goes black:**

* Unplug the HDMI cable.
* Restart your PC.
* Replug the HDMI cable.
