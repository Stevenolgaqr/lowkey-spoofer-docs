## 🚀 Step-by-Step Spoofing Process

### Step 1: Complete Prerequisites

✅ Ensure you've done the **"SPOOFER SETUP"** section completely!

If not, go back to [SPOOFER SETUP](../../spoofer-setup/README.md)

---

### Step 2: Download Spoofer

📥 **[Download from here](../../download/README.md)**

---

### Step 3: Extract and Prepare

1. Make sure you have **WinRAR** downloaded
2. **Extract** the folder
3. **Open** `RUN ME FIRST.bat` as Administrator
4. **Open** `RUN ME ALSO.bat` as Administrator  
5. Now you can open the spoofer as admin - it's called **"Brave.exe"** or **"Loader.exe"**

---

### Step 4: Login

1. **Enter** your license key
2. Click **Activate**
3. Wait for confirmation

---

### Step 5: Save Your Serials

**CRITICAL STEP!**

1. Go to **"Device Info"** tab
2. **Screenshot** ALL your serials with Snipping Tool
3. **Save** the screenshot - you'll need it to verify changes!

---

### Step 6: Permanent Spoof

1. Go to **"Spoof"** tab
2. Click **"Permanent Spoof"**
3. Your motherboard should be **automatically detected**
4. Click **"SPOOF"**

**If NOT detected:**
- Click on **"Other"** button
- Select your motherboard manually
- Then click spoof

---

### Step 7: MAC Address Spoofing

**There are 2 options:**

#### Option A: Ethernet (Cable) Users
**Use:** **PERM MAC SPOOF** 
- For Intel and Realtek adapters
- Permanent spoof that persists

#### Option B: WiFi Users
**Use:** **WIFI MAC SPOOF**
- For WiFi adapters
- Also works for Ethernet users if PERM doesn't work

**Steps:**
1. Select appropriate MAC spoof option
2. Click **Spoof MAC**
3. Wait for confirmation

---

### Step 8: Restart PC

1. **Restart** your computer
2. **Wait** for Windows to fully load

---

### Step 9: Verify Spoofing

1. Open Lowkey Loader again
2. Go to **"Device Info"**
3. Check your serials - they should be **GREEN** ✅
4. Compare with your before screenshot

**Expected results:**
- ✅ Most serials should be GREEN
- ⚪ Some white serials in device tab are normal
- ❌ If red, see [Serials Not Changing](../../additional/troubleshooting/serials-not-changing.md)

## 💾 For USB Boot Users

> ⚠️ **Important for USB boot method:**

**Every time you turn on your PC:**
1. USB must be connected
2. You should see a **5 second countdown**

**For Volume FAT32:**
- Make sure it's in **#1 priority** in boot order
- You should see the 5 second countdown
- If not, check BIOS boot order

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know spoofing worked when:
- ✅ All serials are green in Device Info
- ✅ MAC address changed
- ✅ Motherboard serial changed
- ✅ Disk serial changed
- ✅ No errors during spoof process

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

After successful spoofing:

1. ✅ [Spoof Monitor](spoof-monitor.md) (Apex Legends only)
2. ✅ [Network Unflag](network-unflag.md) (Required!)
3. ✅ [Make New Account](new-account.md)
4. ✅ [Finish](finish.md)

### MAC Spoof Failed
- Try the other MAC spoof option (PERM vs WIFI)
- Ensure network adapter is enabled
- Restart and try again

### Serials Not Changing
